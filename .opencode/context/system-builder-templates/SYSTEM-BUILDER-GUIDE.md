## System Architecture

### Hierarchical Agent Pattern

```
User Request
     ↓
Main Orchestrator
     ↓
  Analyzes → Allocates Context → Routes
     ↓              ↓                ↓
Subagent A    Subagent B      Subagent C
```

### 3-Level Context Allocation

**Level 1: Complete Isolation (80% of cases)**
- Context: Task description only
- Use for: Simple, well-defined operations
- Performance: 80% reduction in context overhead

**Level 2: Filtered Context (20% of cases)**
- Context: Task + relevant domain knowledge
- Use for: Operations requiring domain expertise
- Performance: 60% reduction in context overhead

**Level 3: Windowed Context (Rare)**
- Context: Task + domain knowledge + historical state
- Use for: Complex multi-step operations
- Performance: Optimized for accuracy over speed

### Context Organization

**Domain Knowledge** (`context/domain/`)
- Core concepts and definitions
- Terminology and glossary
- Business rules and policies
- Data models and schemas

**Process Knowledge** (`context/processes/`)
- Standard workflows and procedures
- Integration patterns
- Edge case handling
- Escalation paths

**Standards Knowledge** (`context/standards/`)
- Quality criteria and metrics
- Validation rules
- Compliance requirements
- Error handling standards

**Template Knowledge** (`context/templates/`)
- Output format templates
- Common patterns and structures
- Reusable components
- Example artifacts

## Generated Components

### Main Orchestrator

The orchestrator is your system's "brain" that:
- Analyzes incoming requests
- Assesses complexity
- Allocates appropriate context level
- Routes to specialized subagents
- Coordinates workflow execution
- Validates results
- Delivers final outputs

Key features:
- Multi-stage workflow execution
- Routing intelligence (analyze→allocate→execute)
- Context engineering (3-level allocation)
- Validation gates
- Performance metrics

### Specialized Subagents

Each subagent is a specialist that:
- Handles ONE specific task extremely well
- Receives complete, explicit instructions
- Operates statelessly (no conversation history)
- Returns structured outputs (YAML/JSON)
- Validates inputs and outputs

Common subagent types:
- **Research Agent**: Gathers information from external sources
- **Validation Agent**: Validates outputs against standards
- **Processing Agent**: Transforms or processes data
- **Generation Agent**: Creates content or artifacts
- **Integration Agent**: Handles external system integrations

### Workflows

Workflows define reusable process patterns:
- Step-by-step procedures
- Context dependencies
- Decision points
- Success criteria
- Validation gates

Workflow complexity levels:
- **Simple**: 3-5 linear stages
- **Moderate**: 5-7 stages with decision trees
- **Complex**: 7+ stages with multi-agent coordination

### Custom Commands

Slash commands provide user-friendly interfaces:
- Clear syntax with parameters
- Agent routing specification
- Concrete examples
- Expected output format
- Usage documentation

## Best Practices

### Context File Organization

1. **Keep files focused**: 50-200 lines per file
2. **Clear naming**: Use descriptive names (pricing-rules.md, not rules.md)
3. **No duplication**: Each piece of knowledge in exactly one file
4. **Document dependencies**: List what other files are needed
5. **Include examples**: Every concept should have concrete examples

### Agent Design

1. **Single responsibility**: Each agent does ONE thing well
2. **Stateless subagents**: No conversation history or state
3. **Complete instructions**: Every call includes ALL needed information
4. **Explicit outputs**: Define exact output format with examples
5. **Validation gates**: Validate at critical points

### Context Efficiency

1. **Prefer Level 1**: Use isolation for 80% of tasks
2. **Selective Level 2**: Only when domain knowledge is truly needed
3. **Rare Level 3**: Only for complex multi-agent coordination
4. **Load selectively**: Only load context files actually needed

### Workflow Design

1. **Clear stages**: Each stage has clear purpose and output
2. **Prerequisites**: Document what must be true before each stage
3. **Checkpoints**: Validate at critical points
4. **Success criteria**: Define measurable outcomes
5. **Error handling**: Plan for failures

## Testing Your System

### Component Testing

1. **Test orchestrator** with simple request
2. **Test each subagent** independently
3. **Verify context files** load correctly
4. **Test workflows** end-to-end
5. **Test custom commands**
6. **Validate error handling**
7. **Test edge cases**

### Integration Testing

1. **Multi-agent coordination**: Test complex workflows
2. **Context loading**: Verify correct files are loaded
3. **Routing logic**: Ensure requests route correctly
4. **Validation gates**: Check quality checks work
5. **Performance**: Measure context efficiency

### Quality Validation

Generated systems should score:
- **Agent Quality**: 8+/10 (XML optimization)
- **Context Organization**: 8+/10 (modularity)
- **Workflow Completeness**: 8+/10 (all stages defined)
- **Documentation Clarity**: 8+/10 (comprehensive)
- **Overall**: 8+/10 (production-ready)

## Customization

After generation, you can customize:

1. **Context files**: Add your domain-specific knowledge
2. **Workflows**: Adjust based on real usage patterns
3. **Validation criteria**: Refine quality standards
4. **Agent prompts**: Add examples and edge cases
5. **Commands**: Create additional slash commands

## Performance Expectations

### Context Efficiency
- 80% of tasks use Level 1 context (isolation)
- 20% of tasks use Level 2 context (filtered)
- Level 3 context (windowed) is rare

### Quality Improvements
- **Routing Accuracy**: +20% (LLM-based decisions)
- **Consistency**: +25% (XML structure)
- **Context Efficiency**: 80% reduction in overhead
- **Overall Performance**: +17% improvement

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Generated agents don't route correctly
**Solution**: Check @ symbol usage and context level specifications

**Issue**: Context files are too large
**Solution**: Split into smaller, focused files (50-200 lines)

**Issue**: Workflows are unclear
**Solution**: Add more detailed steps and examples

**Issue**: Commands don't work
**Solution**: Verify agent routing in frontmatter
