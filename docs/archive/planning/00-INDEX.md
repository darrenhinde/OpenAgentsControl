## 🎯 MVP Plan (START HERE)

**`mvp/00-MVP-PLAN.md`** — The 20% that delivers 80% of the value.
5 commands, 6 weeks, focused on what users actually care about.
This is what we build first. Everything else is v1.1+.

## 🚨 Critical Issues Identified

### Security (BLOCKER)
- No component signing
- No malware scanning
- No secret detection
- **Action**: Add security layer in Phase 1

### Discovery (CRITICAL GAP)
- Users can't find components
- **Action**: Add browse/search in Phase 1

### Lockfile (CRITICAL GAP)
- No reproducible installs
- **Action**: Add lockfile in Phase 2

### Version Conflicts (CRITICAL GAP)
- No conflict resolution
- **Action**: Add semver + conflict detection in Phase 2

### Onboarding (HIGH PRIORITY)
- First-time users need guidance
- **Action**: Add interactive wizard in Phase 1
